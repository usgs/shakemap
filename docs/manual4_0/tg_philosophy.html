<p>The overall strategy for the deployment of stations under the ANSS implementation plan
relies on dense instrumentation concentrated in urban areas with high seismic hazards
(<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#usgs1999"><span class="std std-ref">USGS, 1999</span></a>) and fewer stations in outlying areas.  Based on this philosophy, and when
fully deployed, maps generated in these urban regions are expected to be most accurate
where the population at risk is the greatest, and therefore, where emergency response and
recovery efforts will likely be most urgent and complex.</p>
<p>Even so, significant gaps in the observed shaking distribution will likely remain,
especially in the transition from urban to more rural environments. Likewise, many
critical facilities and lifelines are widely distributed, away from population centers and
their dense seismic sensor networks.  Thus, as a fundamental strategy for ShakeMap, we
have developed algorithms to best describe the shaking in more remote areas by utilizing
a variety of seismological tools.  In addition to the areas without sufficient
instrumentation where we would like to estimate motions to help assess the situation, and
as a fail-safe backup, it is also useful to have these algorithms in place in
the event of potential communication dropout from a portion of the network.  The same
tools are, in fact, beneficial for interpolating between observations (i.e., seismic stations) even
within densely instrumented portions of the networks.</p>
<p>If there were stations at each of the tens of thousands of map grid points needed to
adequately portray shaking, then the creation of shaking maps would be relatively simple.
Of course, stations are not available for the overwhelming majority of these grid points, and in many cases grid
points may be tens of kilometers or more from the nearest reporting station.  The overall mapping
philosophy is then to combine information from individual stations, site amplification
characteristics, and ground-motion prediction equations for the distance to the hypocenter
(or to the causative fault) to create the best composite map.  The procedure should
produce reasonable estimates at grid points located far from available data while
preserving the detailed shaking information available for regions where there are stations
nearby.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that mathematically, or algorithmically, geospatial interpolation
can take many forms. There are some good reasons to employ geospatial
kriging-with-a-trend <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging">kriging-with-a-trend</a>.
However, the complexity of the trends (GMPE, as well as inter-event bias
corrections per Intensity Measure or IM), the use of multiply-weighted strong-motion and macroseimic
data, and the real-time nature of the processing require other considerations.
The approach ShakeMap currently employs for interpolation
(<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#worden2018"><span class="std std-ref">Worden et al., 2018</span></a>) applies a conditional
multi-variate normal distribution, within which some or all of the points
upon which the distribution is conditioned may themselves have uncertainty.
It remains to be seen to what extent this approach is analogous
to kriging-with-a-trend mathematically.</p>
<p>Estimating motions where there are few stations, and then interpolating the recordings and
estimates to a fine grid for mapping and contouring, requires several steps. In the
following sections, we describe the process from input to final interpolated grid.</p>
