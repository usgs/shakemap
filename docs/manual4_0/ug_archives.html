<p>All ShakeMaps are available for viewing and download online. The ShakeMap
Archives consist of three primary repositories: <strong>Recent ShakeMaps</strong>, the
<strong>ShakeMap Atlas</strong> for historic earthquakes (primarily 1970-2012), and a
collection of hypothetical earthquake <strong>ShakeMap Scenarios</strong>. For example,
scenario earthquakes compiled for Northern and Southern California represent
over 200 different earthquake ruptures studied for California, as detailed
below. Formats for all ShakeMaps, whether near–real-time, historic, or
future scenarios, are uniform.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Some older archival ShakeMaps
online were generated with earlier versions of the ShakeMap
software; hence, they do not contain up-to-date formats and all
products. This will be remedied as older events are rerun and
updated. One can tell from the <em>processed time</em> on the bottom of
any ShakeMap when it was run.</p>

<p><strong>In the U.S.</strong>, ShakeMaps are generated via independent systems running at ANSS
Regional Seismic Systems (RSNs) in Northern California, Southern California, the
Pacific Northwest, Utah, Nevada, and Alaska. For the rest of the U.S., the
ShakeMap group at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) in
Golden, Colorado
produces maps for the regional networks operating in Hawaii, New England, and
the Central and Eastern U.S. on a system referred to as Global ShakeMap (GSM).
The input, metadata, and output files produced by all these instances are
aggregated by the USGS via the Earthquake Hazards Program web system. GSM
also provides
backup capabilities for the RSNs, but with degraded capabilities; not all data
are flowing from the RSNs to GSM automatically.</p>
<p>Separate independent systems running in Puerto Rico and New England generate
ShakeMaps, but these instances do not deliver them through the USGS
Earthquake Hazards
Program webpages (at the time of this writing). GSM covers these regions but
does not yet access the full set of data available to all of these regional
systems.</p>
<p><strong>Internationally</strong>, USGS ShakeMap is installed and operational in Italy,
France, Portugal, Switzerland, Romania, Indonesia, Iran, Iceland,
Panama, and several other nations (see <a class="pageref" href="#international-shakemaps">Figure  1</a>).
Several instances of ShakeMap are in testing
or operational mode in the Middle East (including Oman, Morocco, and the U.A.E.; M.
Franke, written comm., 2015). In addition, other ShakeMap installations are in
testing in Latin America and the Caribbean (Chile, Colombia, Mexico,
Costa Rica), and in Southeast Asia (Malaysia and Korea). Discussions have taken
place with several other interested countries.</p>

<p>ShakeMap was designed with near–real-time earthquake response purposes
in mind.  However, many of the strategies for mapping the patterns of
peak ground motions for real-time applications described above prove
useful for re-creating the shaking from historic earthquakes.</p>
<p>The ShakeMap Atlas (<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#allen2008"><span class="std std-ref">Allen et al., 2008</span></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#allen2009a"><span class="std std-ref">2009a</span></a>) is a self-consistent, well-calibrated
collection of historic earthquakes for which ShakeMaps were systematically
generated.  The Atlas constitutes an invaluable online resource for
investigating near-source strong ground motion, as well as for seismic
hazard, scenario, risk, and loss-model development.</p>

<p>The original (2009) Atlas is a compilation of nearly 5,000 ShakeMaps for
the most significant global earthquakes between 1973 and 2007
(<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#allen2008"><span class="std std-ref">Allen et al., 2008</span></a>).
<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#garcia2012a"><span class="std std-ref">Garcia et al. (2012a)</span></a> introduced an update of the
Atlas, which extends the time period through 2012,
with a total of 6,100 events. The revised Atlas 2.0 includes: a new version
of the ShakeMap software (V3.5) which improves interpolation and
uncertainty estimations; an updated earthquake source catalogue that
includes regional locations and finite fault models; a refined strategy to
select prediction and conversion equations based on a new seismotectonic
regionalization scheme (<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#garcia2012b"><span class="std std-ref">Garcia et al., 2012b</span></a>); and
vastly more macroseismic-intensity and ground-motion data from international
agencies.</p>
<p>In order to best replicate shaking that occurred during historic and recent
earthquakes, we employ many of the ShakeMap tools described in the previous
sections. For many older events, the important constraints (in addition to
the usual site condition map) are the fault rupture geometry, macroseismic
intensity, and peak ground motion data. As previously described, combining
peak ground motions and macroseismic data was accomplished seamlessly
and rigorously with the new interpolation scheme developed by
<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#worden2018"><span class="std std-ref">Worden et al. (2018)</span></a>. This strategy was in part
aimed at most accurately representing
historic earthquake shaking maps, which are often constrained predominantly
by key macroseismic observations, and is essential for the Atlas.</p>

<p>The Atlas provides a hazard base layer for an number of systems that require
estimates of the shaking values where losses occurred.
To this end, the Atlas is used for the Earthquake Consequences Database
within the Global Earthquake
Model initiative (GEMECD; <a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#so2014"><span class="std std-ref">So, 2014</span></a>).
The “GEMECD subset” is a collection of approximately 100 events which
constitute the most important and damaging
events since about 1973. The purpose of the GEMECD subset is to provide the
Global
Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation—and hence the wider earthquake hazard and
loss community—a common-denominator hazard layer
for calibrating and testing earthquake damage and loss models. The Atlas is
also the calibration hazard layer for the USGS
<a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/pager/">PAGER</a>
system  (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#wald2008"><span class="std std-ref">Wald et al., 2008</span></a>;

liquefaction probability maps, and by <a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#nowicki2014"><span class="std std-ref">Nowicki et al. (2014)</span></a> for near–real-time

importance of calibrating empirical ground failure and loss models against a

<p>In addition to historical and near–real-time applications, ShakeMap has
become widely used for earthquake mitigation and planning exercises through
earthquake scenarios.  A scenario represents one realization of a potential
future earthquake by assuming a particular magnitude, location, and
fault-rupture geometry and estimating shaking using a variety of strategies
(including ShakeMap with GMPEs). Some of the technical issues related to
scenario generation are discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="sm4_technical_guide.html#technical-guide-4"><span class="std std-ref">Technical Guide</span></a>.
Here we cover the many uses for earthquake scenarios from the users’
perspective.</p>
<p>In planning and coordinating emergency response, utilities, local
government, and other organizations are best served by conducting training
exercises based on realistic earthquake situations—ones similar to those
they are most likely to face. ShakeMap Scenario earthquakes can fill this
role. They can also be used to examine exposure of structures, lifelines,
utilities, and transportation corridors to specified potential earthquakes.</p>
<p>The September, 2015, <a class="reference external" href="http://nehrp.gov/pdf/2015ACEHRReportFinal.pdf">Report to NEHRP Agencies from the Advisory Committee on
Earthquake Hazards Reduction (ACEHR)</a>,
notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>USGS Recommendation 4 - ACEHR recommends the USGS expand earthquake scenario
development in conjunction with stakeholder engagement in order to examine
consequences of earthquakes in high-risk urban areas.</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>To this end, USGS ShakeMap webpages now display many earthquake scenarios, and
we are working to develop a comprehensive suite of scenarios for all at-risk
regions of the United States (see <a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#thompson2016"><span class="std std-ref">Thompson et al., 2016</span></a>).</p>

<p>A ShakeMap earthquake scenario is simply a ShakeMap with an assumed
magnitude and location, and, optionally, specified fault geometry. For
example, <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-13u">Figure  4</a> shows ShakeMap scenario intensity (top)
and peak velocity (bottom) maps for a hypothetical earthquake of M7.05 on
the Hayward Fault in the eastern San Francisco Bay area. Due to the
proximity to populated regions of Oakland, Berkeley, and surrounding cities,
this scenario represents one of the most destructive earthquakes that could
impact the region.  Different renditions of this particular scenario have
been widely used for evaluating the region’s capacity to respond to such a
disaster among federal, state, utility, business, and
local emergency response organizations.</p>

<p>The USGS and ANSS partners receive numerous requests for ShakeMap scenarios
annually. The NEIC Global ShakeMap (GSM) operators have also generated scores
of scenarios for colleagues, partners, other federal agencies, non-profit
organizations, and governments around the globe. These and other scenarios
are available online on the ShakeMap webpages. They are formatted the same
as other ShakeMaps, so they can be easily used in response planning and
loss estimation as well as for educational purposes.</p>
<p>ShakeMap earthquake scenarios can be an integral part of earthquake emergency
response planning.  Primary users include city, county, state and
federal government agencies (e.g., the California EMA, FEMA); and
emergency-response planners and managers for utilities, businesses, and other
large organizations.
ShakeMap scenarios are particularly useful in planning and
exercises when combined with loss-estimation systems such as PAGER, HAZUS,
and ShakeCast, which provide ShakeMap-based estimates of overall social and
economic impact, detailed loss estimates, and inspection priorities,
respectively. Since ShakeMap’s inception, operators have generated hundreds
of earthquake scenarios that have been used in formal earthquake response
exercises around the world.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.6.3.1. </span>Generating Earthquake Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-earthquake-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given a selected event, we have developed tools to make it relatively easy
to generate a ShakeMap earthquake scenario. All that is required is to
assume a particular fault or fault segment will (or did) rupture over a
certain length and with a chosen magnitude, and to generate a file
describing the fault geometry and another describing the magnitude and
hypocenter of the ostensible earthquake (see the <a class="reference internal" href="sm4_software_guide.html#software-guide-4"><span class="std std-ref">Software Guide</span></a>
for details). ShakeMap can then estimate the ground shaking at all locations
over a chosen area surrounding the fault and produce a full suite of data
products just as if the event were a real earthquake.  Ground motions are
usually estimated using GMPEs to compute peak ground motions on
rock conditions; however, the operator may also supply ground-motion
estimates from external programs in the form of GMT grid files. As described
in <span class="xref std std-ref">subsec-site-amplification</span>,
ShakeMap corrects the amplitudes based on the local site soil conditions
unless configured otherwise.</p>
<p>At present, ground motions are estimated using empirical attenuation
relationships (though we can use gridded ground-motion estimates from other
sources for those who wish to provide them). We then correct the amplitudes
based on the local site soil conditions (Vs30) as we do in the general
ShakeMap interpolation scheme.  Fault finiteness is included explicitly,
basin depth can be incorporated where appropriate, and source directivity is
included via the relationships developed by
<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#rowshandel2010"><span class="std std-ref">Rowshandel (2010)</span></a>.  Depending on the level of
complexity needed for the scenario, event-specific factors, such as variable
slip distribution, could also be incorporated in the amplitude estimates fed
to ShakeMap.</p>
<p>In most cases, we do not consider the direction of rupture, nor do we modify
the peak motions by a directivity term. Fault geometries are specified with
a fault file that represents the fault planar segments. With this approach,
the location of the earthquake hypocenter does not have any effect on the
resulting ground-motions; only the location and dimensions of the fault
matter. If we were to add directivity to the calculations, then different
choices of hypocentral location could result in significantly different
motions for the same magnitude earthquake and fault segment.</p>
<p>Rather, our approach is to generally show the average effect because it
is difficult to justify a particular choice of hypocenter or to show the
results for every possible hypocentral location. Our empirical predictive
approach also only gives median peak–ground-motion values, so it does not
account for all the expected variability in motions, only the
aforementioned site amplification variations. Actual ground motions show
significant variability for a given distance, magnitude, and site condition
and, hence, the scenario ground-motions are more uniform than would be
expected for a real earthquake.  2D and 3D wave propagation, path effects
(such as basin edge amplification and focusing), differences in motions
among earthquakes of the same magnitude, and complex site effects are not
accounted for with our methodology. For scenarios in which we wish to
explore directivity explicitly, ShakeMap includes a tool based on
<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#rowshandel2010"><span class="std std-ref">Rowshandel (2010)</span></a> as shown in
<a class="pageref" href="#figure1-13u">Figure  4</a>. We
are also exploring delivery of scenarios with multiple realizations of
spatial variability (see <a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#verros2016"><span class="std std-ref">Verros et al. (2016)</span></a>.</p>
<p>In terms of generating scenarios with the ShakeMap system, a number of
specific considerations and a number of configuration changes are made for
scenario events as opposed to actual events triggered by the network.
For example, after generating a scenario for a major but hypothetical
event, obviously one does not want to automatically deliver the files to
customers who are expecting real events.  To avoid these sorts of
errors, the <em>Event ID*s for all scenarios are tagged with the suffix *_se</em>.
Such events are recognized by the processing and delivery software, which is
configured to handle the scenarios as special cases. Scenarios are also
given their own separate space on the webpages. The scenario earthquake
ground-motion maps are identical to those made for real earthquakes, with
one exception: ShakeMap scenarios are labeled with the word “SCENARIO”
prominently displayed to avoid potential confusion with real earthquake
occurrences.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">3.6.3.2. </span>Standardizing Earthquake Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#standardizing-earthquake-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The USGS has evaluated the probabilistic hazard from active faults in
the U.S. for the
<a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/">National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project</a>.
From these maps it is
possible to prioritize the best scenario earthquakes to be used in planning
exercises by considering the most likely candidate earthquake fault first,
followed by the next likely, and so on. Such an analysis is easily
accomplished by hazard disaggregation, in which the contributions of
individual earthquakes to the total seismic hazard, their probability of
occurrence, and the severity of the ground-motions are ranked.  Using the
individual disaggregated components of these hazard maps, a user can select
the appropriate scenarios given their location, regional extent, and
specific planning requirements.</p>
<p>ShakeMap operators are in the process (early 2016; see
<a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#thompson2016"><span class="std std-ref">Thompson et al., 2016</span></a>) of developing a full suite of
scenario ShakeMaps from the disaggregated U.S. National Seismic Hazard Map
event catalog produced by <a class="reference internal" href="sm4_references.html#petersen2014"><span class="std std-ref">Petersen et al. (2014)</span></a>.
By disaggregating these hazard maps, we will
be able to produce scenarios for a substantial number of the potential
significant earthquakes
in the United States. It is hoped that these scenarios will satisfy most of
the requests that ShakeMap operators typically receive, and the need for ad
hoc scenarios will be minimized. Each regional seismic network will be
ultimately responsible for producing the scenarios for their region using
their local ShakeMap configuration and the fault and magnitude information
provided from the hazard maps.  For areas outside of the regional networks,
we will use the Global ShakeMap system to produce the scenarios.
International ShakeMap operators may be able to follow a similar
disaggregation of their own seismic hazard maps to generate a suite of
scenarios.</p>
<p>After a suite of standardized ShakeMap scenarios is developed for a region or
a state, the ShakeMaps can be processed through HAZUS-MH, FEMA’s loss and
risk estimation software, to
develop associated damage estimates and other loss information products.
Both Utah and Washington State officials have worked with USGS, FEMA,
and other collaborators to produce online collections for scenario exercises
and mitigation efforts, shown in <a class="pageref" href="#shakemap-hazus-utah">Figure  5</a> and
