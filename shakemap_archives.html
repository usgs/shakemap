<p>All ShakeMaps are available for viewing and download online. The ShakeMap
Archives consist of three primary repositories: <strong>Recent ShakeMaps</strong>, the
<strong>ShakeMap Atlas</strong> for historic earthquakes (primarily 1970-2012), and a
collection of hypothetical earthquake <strong>ShakeMap Scenarios</strong>. For example,
scenario earthquakes compiled for Northern and Southern California represent
over 200 different earthquake ruptures studied for California, as detailed
below. Formats for all ShakeMaps, whether near&#8211;real-time, historic, or
future scenarios, are uniform.</p>

<h2>Real-time ShakeMaps<a class="headerlink" href="#real-time-shakemaps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>In the U.S.</strong>, ShakeMaps are generated via independent systems running at ANSS
Regional Seismic Systems (RSNs) in Northern California, Southern California, the
Pacific Northwest, Utah, Nevada, and Alaska. For the rest of the U.S., the
ShakeMap group at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) in Golden, Colorado
produces maps for the regional networks operating in Hawaii, New England, and
the Central and Eastern U.S. on a system referred to as Global ShakeMap (GSM).
The input, metadata, and output files produced by all these instances are
aggregated by the USGS via the Earthquake Hazards Program web system. GSM also provides
backup capabilities for the RSNs, but with degraded capabilities; not all data
are flowing from the RSNs to GSM automatically.</p>
<p>Separate independent systems running in Puerto Rico and New England generate
ShakeMaps, but these instances do not deliver them through the USGS Earthquake Hazards
Program webpages (at the time of this writing). GSM covers these regions but
does not yet access the full set of data available to these regional
systems. For more information on the ANSS regional and the national
ShakeMap system implementations and operations, see the section on <a class="reference internal" href="regionals.html#sec-regionals"><span>Regional Operations</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Internationally</strong>, USGS ShakeMap is installed and operational in Italy,
France, Portugal, Switzerland, New Zealand, Romania, Indonesia, Iran, Iceland,
Panama, and several other nations (see <a class="pageref" href="#international-shakemaps">Figure  1</a>).
Several instances of ShakeMap are in testing
or operational mode in the Middle East (including Oman, Morocco, and the U.A.E.; M.
Franke, written comm., 2015). In addition, other ShakeMap installations are in
testing in Latin America and the Caribbean (Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Mexico,
Costa Rica), and in Southeast Asia (Malaysia and Korea). Discussions have taken
place with several other interested countries.</p>

<h2>ShakeMap Atlas<a class="headerlink" href="#shakemap-atlas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ShakeMap was designed with near&#8211;real-time earthquake response purposes in mind.
However, many of the strategies for mapping the patterns of peak ground motions for
real-time applications described above prove useful for re-creating the shaking from
historic earthquakes.</p>
<p>The ShakeMap Atlas (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2008"><span>Allen et al., 2008</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2009a"><span>2009a</span></a>) is a self-consistent, well-calibrated
collection of historic earthquakes for which ShakeMaps were systematically generated.
The Atlas constitutes an invaluable online resource for investigating near-source strong
ground motion, as well as for seismic hazard, scenario, risk, and loss-model
development.</p>

<p>The original (2009) Atlas is a compilation of nearly 5,000 ShakeMaps for the most
significant global earthquakes between 1973 and 2007 (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2008"><span>Allen et al., 2008</span></a>).
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#garcia2012a"><span>Garcia et al. (2012a)</span></a> introduced an update of the Atlas, which extends the time period through 2012,
with a total of 6,100 events. The revised Atlas 2.0 includes: a new version of the
ShakeMap software (V3.5) which improves interpolation and uncertainty estimations;
an updated earthquake source catalogue that includes regional locations and finite fault
models; a refined strategy to select prediction and conversion equations based on a
new seismotectonic regionalization scheme (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#garcia2012b"><span>Garcia et al., 2012b</span></a>); and vastly more
macroseismic-intensity and ground-motion data from international agencies.</p>
<p>In order to best replicate shaking that occurred during historic and recent earthquakes, we
employ many of the ShakeMap tools described in the previous sections. For many older
events, the important constraints (in addition to the usual site condition map) are the
fault rupture geometry, macroseismic intensity, and peak ground motion data. As
previously described, combining peak ground motions and macroseismic data was accomplished seamlessly
and rigorously with the new interpolation scheme developed by
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2010"><span>Worden et al. (2010)</span></a>. This strategy was in part aimed at most accurately representing
historic earthquake shaking maps, which are often constrained predominantly by key
macroseismic observations, and is essential for the Atlas.</p>

<p>The Atlas provides a hazard base layer for an number of systems that require estimates of the shaking values where losses occurred.
To this end, the Atlas is used for the Earthquake Consequences Database within the Global Earthquake
Model initiative (GEMECD; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#so2014"><span>So, 2014</span></a>).
The &#8220;GEMECD subset&#8221; is a collection of approximately 100 events which constitute
the most important and damaging
events since about 1973. The purpose of the GEMECD subset is to provide the
Global
Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation&#8212;and hence the wider earthquake hazard and
loss community&#8212;a common-denominator hazard layer
for calibrating and testing earthquake damage and loss models. The Atlas is also
the calibration hazard layer for the USGS
<a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/pager/">PAGER</a> system  (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald2008"><span>Wald et

<p>A subset of the Atlas was also employed by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#zhu2014"><span>Zhu et al. (2014)</span></a>
for the calibration of near&#8211;real-time
liquefaction probability maps, and by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#nowicki2014"><span>Nowicki et al. (2014)</span></a> for near&#8211;real-time
landslide mapping. As with earlier studies (including <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#godt2008"><span>Godt et al., 2008</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#jaiswal2010"><span>Jaiswal et al.,

importance of calibrating empirical ground failure and loss models against a
standardized
set of uniformly-produced shaking hazard maps so as to allow comparison of
models
based on consistent hazard inputs. <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-15">Figure  3</a> shows an example of

<p>In addition to historical and near&#8211;real-time applications, ShakeMap has become widely
used for earthquake mitigation and planning exercises through earthquake scenarios.
A scenario represents one realization of a potential future earthquake by assuming a
particular magnitude, location, and fault-rupture geometry and estimating shaking using a
variety of strategies (including ShakeMap with GMPEs).
Some of the technical issues related to scenario generation are discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#technical-guide"><span>Technical Guide</span></a>.
Here we cover the many uses for earthquake scenarios from the users&#8217; perspective.</p>
<p>In planning and coordinating emergency response, utilities, local government, and other
organizations are best served by conducting training exercises based on realistic
earthquake situations&#8212;ones similar to those they are most likely to face. ShakeMap
Scenario earthquakes can fill this role. They can also be used to examine
exposure of structures, lifelines, utilities, and transportation corridors to specified
potential earthquakes.</p>
<p>The September, 2015, <a class="reference external" href="http://nehrp.gov/pdf/2015ACEHRReportFinal.pdf">Report to NEHRP Agencies from the Advisory Committee on
Earthquake Hazards Reduction (ACEHR)</a>,
notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>USGS Recommendation 4 - ACEHR recommends the USGS expand earthquake scenario
development in conjunction with stakeholder engagement in order to examine
consequences of earthquakes in high-risk urban areas.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>To this end, USGS ShakeMap webpages now display many earthquake scenarios, and
we are working to develop a comprehensive suite of scenarios for all at-risk
regions of the United States (see <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#thompson2016"><span>Thompson et al., 2016</span></a>).</p>

with the EEW program.</em></div></blockquote>
<p>A ShakeMap earthquake scenario is simply a ShakeMap with an assumed magnitude and
location, and, optionally, specified fault geometry. For example, <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-13u">Figure  4</a> shows
ShakeMap scenario intensity (top) and peak velocity (bottom) maps for a hypothetical
earthquake of M7.05 on the Hayward Fault in the eastern San Francisco Bay area. Due to
the proximity to populated regions of Oakland, Berkeley, and surrounding cities, this
scenario represents one of the most destructive earthquakes that could impact the region.
Different renditions of this particular scenario have been widely used for evaluating the
region&#8217;s capacity to respond to such a disaster among federal, state, utility, business, and
local emergency response organizations.</p>

<p>The USGS and ANSS partners receive numerous requests for ShakeMap scenarios
annually. The NEIC Global ShakeMap (GSM) operators have also generated scores
of scenarios for colleagues, partners, other federal agencies, non-profit organizations,
and governments around the globe. These and other scenarios are available online
on the ShakeMap webpages. They are formatted the same as other ShakeMaps, so they
can be easily used in response planning and loss estimation as well as for educational
purposes.</p>
<p>ShakeMap earthquake scenarios can be an integral part of earthquake emergency
response planning.
Primary users include city, county, state and
federal government agencies (e.g., the California EMA, FEMA); and
emergency-response planners and managers for utilities, businesses, and other
large organizations.
ShakeMap scenarios are particularly useful in planning and
exercises when combined with loss-estimation systems such as PAGER, HAZUS, and
ShakeCast, which provide ShakeMap-based estimates of overall social and economic
impact, detailed loss estimates, and inspection priorities, respectively. Since
ShakeMap’s inception, operators have generated hundreds of earthquake
scenarios that have been used in formal earthquake response exercises around the
world.</p>

<h3>Generating Earthquake Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-earthquake-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Given a selected event, we have developed tools to make it relatively easy to generate a
ShakeMap earthquake scenario. All that is required is to assume a particular fault or fault
segment will (or did) rupture over a certain length and with a chosen magnitude, and to
generate a file describing the fault geometry and another describing the magnitude and
hypocenter of the ostensible earthquake (see the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#software-guide"><span>Software &amp; Implementation Guide</span></a> for details). ShakeMap
can then estimate the ground shaking at all locations over a chosen area surrounding the
fault and produce a full suite of data products just as if the event were a real earthquake.
Ground motions are usually estimated using GMPEs to compute peak ground motions on
rock conditions; however, the operator may also supply ground-motion estimates from
external programs in the form of GMT grid files. As described in <a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#amplify-ground-motions"><span>Amplify Ground Motions</span></a>,
ShakeMap corrects the amplitudes based on the local site soil conditions unless
configured otherwise.</p>
<p>At present, ground motions are estimated using empirical attenuation
relationships (though we can use gridded ground-motion estimates from other
sources for those who wish to provide them). We then correct the amplitudes
based on the local site soil conditions (Vs30) as we do in the general ShakeMap
interpolation scheme.  Fault finiteness is included explicitly, basin depth can
be incorporated where appropriate, and source directivity is included via the
relationships developed by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#rowshandel2010"><span>Rowshandel (2010)</span></a>.  Depending on the level of
complexity needed for the scenario, event-specific factors, such as variable
slip distribution, could also be incorporated in the amplitude estimates fed to
ShakeMap.</p>
<p>In most cases, we do not consider the direction of rupture, nor do we modify the peak
motions by a directivity term. Fault geometries are specified with a fault file that
represents the fault planar segments. With this approach, the location of
the earthquake hypocenter does not have any effect on the resulting ground-motions; only
the location and dimensions of the fault matter. If we were to add directivity to the
calculations, then different choices of hypocentral location could result in significantly
different motions for the same magnitude earthquake and fault segment.</p>
<p>Rather, our approach is to generally show the average effect because it is difficult to justify a
particular choice of hypocenter or to show the results for every possible hypocentral
location. Our empirical predictive approach also only gives median peak&#8211;ground-motion
values, so it does not account for all the expected variability in motions, only the
aforementioned site amplification variations. Actual ground motions show significant
variability for a given distance, magnitude, and site condition and, hence, the scenario
ground-motions are more uniform than would be expected for a real earthquake.
2D and 3D wave propagation, path effects (such as
basin edge amplification and focusing), differences in motions among earthquakes of the
same magnitude, and complex site effects are not accounted for with our methodology.
For scenarios in which we wish to explore directivity explicitly, ShakeMap includes a
tool based on <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#rowshandel2010"><span>Rowshandel (2010)</span></a> as shown in
<a class="pageref" href="#figure1-13u">Figure  4</a> and described in <a class="reference internal" href="technical_guide.html#sec-directivity"><span>Directivity</span></a>. We
are also exploring delivery of scenarios with multiple realizations of

<p>In terms of generating scenarios with the ShakeMap system, a number of specific
considerations and a number of configuration changes are made for scenario events as
opposed to actual events triggered by the network.  For example, after generating a
scenario for a major but hypothetical event, obviously one does not want to automatically
deliver the files to customers who are expecting real events.  To avoid these sorts of
errors, the <em>Event ID*s for all scenarios are tagged with the suffix *_se</em>. Such events are
recognized by the processing and delivery software, which is configured to handle the
scenarios as special cases. Scenarios are also given their own separate space on the
webpages. The scenario earthquake ground-motion maps are identical to those made for real earthquakes, with one exception: ShakeMap scenarios are labeled with the word “SCENARIO” prominently displayed to avoid potential confusion with real earthquake occurrences.</p>

<h3>Standardizing Earthquake Scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#standardizing-earthquake-scenarios" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The USGS has evaluated the probabilistic hazard from active faults in
the U.S. for the <a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/">National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project</a>.
From these maps it is
possible to prioritize the best scenario earthquakes to be used in planning exercises by
considering the most likely candidate earthquake fault first, followed by the next likely,
and so on. Such an analysis is easily accomplished by hazard disaggregation, in which the
contributions of individual earthquakes to the total seismic hazard, their probability of
occurrence, and the severity of the ground-motions are ranked.  Using the individual
disaggregated components of these hazard maps, a user can select the appropriate
scenarios given their location, regional extent, and specific planning requirements.</p>
<p>ShakeMap operators are in the process (early 2016; see <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#thompson2016"><span>Thompson et al., 2016</span></a>) of developing a full suite of
scenario ShakeMaps from the disaggregated U.S. National Seismic Hazard Map event
catalog produced by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#petersen2014"><span>Petersen et al. (2014)</span></a>. By disaggregating these hazard maps, we will
be able to produce scenarios for a substantial number of the potential significant earthquakes
in the United States. It is hoped that these scenarios will satisfy most of
the requests that ShakeMap operators typically receive, and the need for ad
hoc scenarios will be minimized. Each regional seismic network will be ultimately
responsible for producing the scenarios for their region using their local ShakeMap
configuration and the fault and magnitude information provided from the hazard maps.
For areas outside of the regional networks, we will use the Global ShakeMap system to
produce the scenarios. International ShakeMap operators may be able to follow a similar
disaggregation of their own seismic hazard maps to generate a suite of scenarios.</p>
<p>After a suite of standardized ShakeMap scenarios is developed for a region or
a state, the ShakeMaps can be processed through HAZUS-MH, FEMA&#8217;s loss and risk estimation software, to
develop associated damage estimates and other loss information products.
Both Utah and Washington State officials have worked with USGS, FEMA,
and other collaborators to produce online collections for scenario exercises and mitigation efforts,
shown in <a class="pageref" href="#shakemap-hazus-utah">Figure  5</a> and <a class="pageref" href="#shakemap-hazus-washington">Figure  6</a>, respectively.</p>
