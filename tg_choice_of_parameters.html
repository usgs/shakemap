<p>With ShakeMap, we chose to represent peak ground motions as recorded. We depict the
larger of the two horizontal components, rather than as either a vector sum, or as a
geometric mean value. The initial choice of peak values was necessitated by the fact that
roughly two-thirds of the TriNet (now the Southern California portion of CISN) strong-
motion data (the California Geological Survey, or CGS, data)
are delivered as peak values for individual components of
motion, that is, as parametric data rather than waveforms. This left two options: providing peak
values or median of the peak values&#8212;determining vector sums of the two horizontal
components was not an option, because the peak values on each component do not
necessarily occur at the same time.  A useful strategy going forward may be to employ
the 50th percentile of the response spectra over all non-redundant rotation angles
(RotD50; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#boore2010"><span>Boore, 2010</span></a>), which is becoming a standard
for &#8220;next-generation&#8221;
GMPEs (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#abrahamson2014"><span>Abrahamson et al., 2014</span></a>), or on another
agreed-upon vector-component
calculation. (See <a class="reference internal" href="future_directions.html#future-directions"><span>Future Directions</span></a>). However, such changes would
require adoption of these
calculations on the part of each contributing seismic network, and would thus require
consensus (and substantial software upgrades) all around.</p>
<p>Despite the common use of mean values in attenuation relations and loss estimation, we
decided that computing and depicting median values, which effectively reduces
information and discards the largest values of shaking, was not acceptable. This is
particularly true for highly directional near-fault pulse-like ground motions, for which
peak velocities can be large on one component and small on the other.  Mean values for
such motions (particularly when determined in logarithmic space) can seriously underrepresent
the largest motion that a building may have experienced, and these pulse-like motions are
typically associated with the regions of greatest damage. Thus, we chose peak ground
motions as the parameters to be mapped.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="references.html#beyer2006"><span>Beyer and Bommer (2006)</span></a> provide statistical relationships
to convert among median and
peak parameters and between aleatory variability for different definitions of the
horizontal component of motion. This is useful when approximating alternative
components than those presented, but one must recognize that for any individual record,
these statistics may or may not be representative.</p>
<p>Initially, our use of PGA and PGV for estimating intensities was also simply practical.
We were retrieving only peak values from a large subset of the network, so it was
impractical to compute more specific ground-motion parameters, such as average-
response spectral values, kinetic energy, cumulative absolute velocities (CAV, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#epri1991"><span>EPRI,
1991</span></a>), or the JMA intensity algorithm (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#jma1996"><span>JMA, 1996</span></a>). However, because
near-source strong ground motions are often dominated by short-duration, pulse-like
ground motions (usually associated with source directivity), PGV appears to be a robust measure
of intensity for strong shaking. In other words, the kinetic energy (proportional to
velocity squared) available for damage is well characterized by PGV. In addition, the
close correspondence of the JMA intensities and peak ground velocity
indicates that our use of peak ground velocities for higher intensities was
consistent with the algorithm used by JMA. Work by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wu2003"><span>Wu et al. (2003)</span></a> indicates a very
good correspondence between PGV and damage for data collected on the island of Taiwan,
which included high-quality loss data and densely sampled strong-motion observations
for the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. More recent work on Ground-Motion/Intensity
Conversion Equations (GMICEs) (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#atkinson2007"><span>Atkinson and Kaka, 2007</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2012"><span>Worden, et al., 2012</span></a>) has also
confirmed the strong relationship between PGV and intensity.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, for large, distant earthquakes, peak motions may be less informative, and
spectral content and perhaps duration become key parameters.  Although we may eventually
adopt corrections for these situations, it is difficult to assign intensities in such cases. For
instance, it is difficult to assign the intensity in the zone of Mexico City where numerous
high-rises collapsed during the 1985 Michoacan earthquake. There was obviously high-
intensity shaking for high-rise buildings; however, most smaller buildings were
unaffected, suggesting a much lower intensity.  Whereas PGVs were
moderate and would imply intensity VIII, resonance and duration conspired to cause a
more substantial damage than peak values would indicate. Although this is, in part, a
shortcoming of using peak parameters alone, it is more a limitation imposed by
simplifying the complexity of ground motions into a single parameter. Therefore, in
addition to providing peak ground-motion values and intensity, we are also producing
spectral response maps (for 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec). Users who can process this information
for loss estimation will have a clearer picture than can be provided with maps of PGA
and PGV alone. However, as discussed earlier, a simple intensity map is extremely useful
for the overwhelming majority of users, which includes the general public and many
people involved with the initial emergency response.</p>
