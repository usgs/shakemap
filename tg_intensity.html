<p><a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald1999b"><span>Wald et al. (1999b)</span></a> relates recorded ground motions to Modified Mercalli Intensities in
California. While not the first work of its type, Wald et al. had the advantage of using
several earthquakes that were both very well surveyed for MMI, and also well
instrumented for recorded ground motions. By relating the ground motions to MMI, Wald
et al. made possible the rapid calculation of expected intensities from recorded ground
motions. These “instrumental intensities” could be interpolated over an area and
represented on a map.</p>
<p>As part of the original implementation of ShakeMap, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald1999a"><span>Wald, et al. (1999a)</span></a> developed a
color scale to represent expected intensities over the mapped area. This scale gives users
an intuitive, easy-to-understand depiction of the ground shaking for a given earthquake.
By mapping intensity to color, we also make the hardest-hit areas stand out for
emergency responders and members of the media. Along with the color scale, we
developed simplified two-word descriptions of the felt intensity as well as the likely
damage. These abridged descriptions are not meant to replace
more comprehensive descriptions provided in the MMI (e.g.,
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dewey2000"><span>Dewey et al., 2000</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dewey1995"><span>Dewey et al., 1995</span></a>),
or EMS-98 (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#grunthal1998"><span>Grunthal et al., 1998</span></a>) scales; however, they offer convenient description for
our purposes.</p>
<p>By relating recorded peak ground motions to Modified Mercalli Intensities, we can
generate instrumental intensities within a few minutes of an earthquake. In the current
ShakeMap system, these instrumental intensities can be combined with direct measures
of intensity (from “Did You Feel It?”, for example) and interpolated across the affected area. With the
color-coding and two-word text descriptors, we can adequately describe the associated
perceived shaking and potential damage consistent with both human response and
damage assessments of past earthquakes to characterize the shaking from just-occurred
earthquakes.</p>

<h2>2.6.1. Color Palette for the ShakeMap Instrumental Intensity Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#color-palette-for-the-shakemap-instrumental-intensity-scale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The color coding for the Instrumental Intensity map uses a standard rainbow palette (see Table
1.1).  The &#8220;cool&#8221; to &#8220;hot&#8221; color scheme is familiar to most and is readily recognizable,
as it is used as a standard in many fields (for example, see USA Today&#8217;s daily temperature
maps of the U.S.).  Note that we do not believe intensity II and III can be consistently
distinguished from ground-motions alone, so they are grouped together, see <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-16">Figure  1</a>. In
addition, we saturate intensity X+ with dark red; observed ground motions alone are not
sufficient to warrant any higher intensities, given that the available empirical relationships
do not have any values of intensity greater than IX. In recent years, the USGS has limited
observed MMIs to IX, reserving intensity X for possible future
observations (see <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dewey1995"><span>Dewey et al., 1995</span></a>, for more details); the USGS no
longer assigns intensity XI and XII. We note that there were only
only two intensity-IX assignments for the 1994 Northridge earthquake (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dewey1995"><span>Dewey et al., 1995</span></a>),
and only two or three proper intensity-IX assignments for the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (J. Dewey, 2015, personal communication).</p>

<h2>2.6.2. ShakeMap Instrumental Intensity Scale Text Descriptions<a class="headerlink" href="#shakemap-instrumental-intensity-scale-text-descriptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The estimated intensity map is usually wholly or partially derived from ground motions
recorded by seismic instruments, and represents intensities that are likely to have been
associated with the recorded ground motions. However, unlike conventional intensities,
the instrumental intensities are not based on observations of the earthquake’s effects on
people or structures. The terms &#8220;perceived shaking&#8221; and &#8220;potential damage&#8221; in the
ShakeMap legend are chosen for this reason; these intensities were not observed, but they
are consistent on average with intensities at these ranges of ground motions recorded in a
number of past earthquakes (see, for example, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald1999b"><span>Wald et al., 1999b</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2012"><span>Worden et al., 2012</span></a>).
Two-word descriptions of both shaking and damage levels are provided to summarize the
effects in an area; they were derived with careful consideration of the existing
descriptions in the Modified Mercalli definitions (L. Dengler and J. Dewey, written
communication, 1998, 2003).</p>
<p>The ShakeMap qualitative descriptions of shaking are intended to be consistent with the way
people perceive the shaking in earthquakes.  The descriptions for intensities up to VII are
constrained by the work of <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dengler1998"><span>Dengler and Dewey (1998)</span></a>, in which they compared results of
telephone surveys with USGS MMI intensities for the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The
ShakeMap descriptions up to intensity VII may be viewed as a rendering of Dengler and
Dewey&#8217;s Figure 7a.</p>
<p>The instrumental intensity map for the Northridge earthquake shares most of the notable
features of the Modified Mercalli map prepared by the USGS (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dewey1995"><span>Dewey et al., 1995</span></a>),
including the relatively high intensities near Santa Monica and southeast of the epicenter
near Sherman Oaks.  However, in general, the area of intensity IX on the instrumentally
derived intensity map is slightly larger than on the USGS Modified Mercalli intensity
map. This reflects the fact that although much of the Santa Susanna mountains, north and
northwest of the epicenter, were very strongly shaken, the region is also sparsely
populated, hence, observed intensities could not be determined there.  This is a fundamental
difference between observed and instrumentally derived intensities: instrumental
intensities will show high levels of strong shaking independent of the exposure of
populations and buildings, while observed intensities only represent intensities where there are
structures to damage and people to experience the earthquake.</p>
<p>The ShakeMap descriptions of felt shaking begin to lose meaning above intensity VII or VIII. In
the <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dengler1998"><span>Dengler and Dewey (1998)</span></a> study, peoples&#8217; perception of shaking began to saturate in
the VII-VIII range, with more than half the people at VII-VIII and above
reporting the shaking as &#8220;violent&#8221; (on a scale from &#8220;weak&#8221; to &#8220;violent”).  In the ShakeMap
descriptions, we intensified the descriptions of shaking with increases of intensity above
VII, because the evidence from instrumental data is that the shaking is stronger.  But we
know of no solid evidence that one could discriminate intensities higher than VII on the
basis of different individuals&#8217; descriptions of perceived shaking alone.</p>
<p>ShakeMap is not unique in describing intensity VI as corresponding to strong shaking. In
the 7-point Japanese macroseismic scale, for which intensity 4 is equivalent to MMI VI,
intensity 4 is described as &#8220;strong.&#8221; In the European Macroseismic Scale (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#grunthal1998"><span>Grunthel et al.,
1998</span></a>) (EMS-98), which is compatible with MMI (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#musson2010"><span>Musson et al., 2010</span></a>), the bullet description of intensity
V is  &#8220;strong.&#8221;  Higher EMS-98 intensities are given bullet descriptions in terms of the
damage they produce, rather than the strength of perceived shaking.</p>

<h2>2.6.3. ShakeMap Intensity Scale and Peak Ground Motions<a class="headerlink" href="#shakemap-intensity-scale-and-peak-ground-motions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ShakeMap Instrumental Intensity Scale Legend provides the PGA and PGV
associated with the central value in each
intensity box (see <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-16">Figure  1</a>). For all current GMICEs, the ground motion scale is
logarithmic, with an increase of one intensity unit resulting from approximately a
doubling of peak ground motion. Nevertheless, each GMICE has its own mapping of
ground motion to intensity, and thus the values shown in the scale legend can vary,
depending on the GMICE chosen for the map in question. To avoid confusion, the
legends now have a citation in the lower left specifying which GMICE was used to
produce the map and scale. Note, however, that while the mapping of ground motion to
intensity varies, the mapping of color to intensity remains the same for all maps.</p>
<p>We note that the ShakeMap legends (e.g., <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-16">Figure  1</a>) have evolved slightly from the
earlier version of ShakeMap and the 2005 ShakeMap Manual. The PGMs tabulated are
no longer provided by (previously redundant) PGM ranges, but rather by the median
motions associated with the intensity on the scale.</p>

<h2>2.6.4. Color Coding Stations by Intensity<a class="headerlink" href="#color-coding-stations-by-intensity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, stations on the PGM ShakeMaps were color-coded to the seismic network
that provided them. More recent versions of ShakeMap, however, allow the operator to
color the stations with the intensity they produced, with each PGM parameter (e.g., PGA,
PGV, PSA03) using its own intensity correlation. <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-11">Figure  2</a> (and
many of the other figures throughout this guide) illustrates the color coding of stations
