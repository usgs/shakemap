<h2>2.3.1. Data Acquisition<a class="headerlink" href="#data-acquisition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ShakeMap requires estimates of magnitude, location, and (optionally, but preferably)
shaking IMs at seismic stations. As such, ShakeMap has been interfaced with
several types of seismic processing systems in wide use at numerous networks across the U.S. and
around the world, including <a class="reference external" href="http://antelopeusersgroup.org/">Antelope</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.seiscomp3.org/">SeisComP3</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.isti.com/products/aqms/">AQMS</a>.
The ShakeMap system,
however, is a stand-alone software package and is really a passive consumer of seismic
data. In other words, the ShakeMap software itself contains no data acquisition component. It is
assumed that ShakeMap earthquake source information and parametric data are packaged
for delivery to ShakeMap and that that delivery will trigger a ShakeMap run. The
required format is an XML format, as fully described in the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span>Software Guide</span></a>.
Some programs are provided to convert ASCII text and other formats to the required input
XML.
It is assumed that station data delivered to ShakeMap are free-field sites that have been
vetted by the contributing network. Each station must have stand-alone metadata
describing its station location, contributing network, channel, and location code. While some
additional outlier and data quality checks are performed within ShakeMap (see
<a class="reference internal" href="tg_processing.html#sec-shakemap-processing"><span>ShakeMap Processing</span></a>), it is assumed that this is primarily the
responsibility of the contributing seismic network.</p>
<p>For global and historic earthquake ShakeMap generation, we have developed scripts to
preprocess various forms of seismic waveform (as well as macroseismic) data which are
openly available around the world. For example, we provide a Python
script <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mhearne-usgs/smtools">getstrong.py</a>
that runs independently of ShakeMap, as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#software-guide"><span>Software &amp; Implementation Guide</span></a>.</p>
<p>For illustrative purposes, we describe the data acquisition for the seismic system in
Southern California, a component of the California Integrated Seismic Network (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cisn.org">CISN</a>).
For perspective, as of 2015, there were nearly 800 real-time stations jointly operated with
a collaboration between the USGS and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). In addition, the California Geological Survey (CGS)
contributes nearly 350 strong-motion stations in near real-time, utilizing an automated
telephone dial-up procedure (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#shakal1998"><span>Shakal et al, 1998</span></a>), and the USGS National Strong Motion
Instrumentation Program (NSMP) contributes dial-up station parameters as well, with
nearly 50 stations in Southern California alone.  Lastly, the
<a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/netquakes/map">&#8220;NetQuakes&#8221;</a> program, a
relatively low-cost seismograph that the USGS installs in homes, businesses, buildings, and
schools, contributes close to 100 additional stations in Southern California.</p>
<p>Generation of ShakeMap in Southern California is automatic, triggered by the event
associator of the seismic network.  Within the first two minutes of an earthquake, ground-motion
parameters are available from the USGS-Caltech component of the network, and
within several minutes most of the important near-source CGS and NSMP stations contribute; a
more complete CGS and NSMP contribution is available within approximately
ten minutes of an event.  Initial maps are made with the real-time component of CISN as
well as any of the available dial-sites, and they are updated automatically as more data
are acquired.</p>

<div class="section" id="derived-parametric-ground-motion-values">
<h2>2.3.2. Derived Parametric Ground-motion Values<a class="headerlink" href="#derived-parametric-ground-motion-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Parametric data from stations serving ShakeMap should include peak ground acceleration
(PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), and peak response spectral acceleration amplitudes
(at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec).  Often, parametric values are derived continuously, using
recursive time-domain filtering as described by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#kanamori1999"><span>Kanamori et al. (1999)</span></a>.  Otherwise
parameters are derived from post-processing as described by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#shakal1998"><span>Shakal et al. (1998)</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#converse1992"><span>Converse and Brady (1992)</span></a>.</p>
<p>ShakeMap will run successfully with no (or limited) parametric data, for example if only
PGA values are available at each station. Default logic is employed to provide reasonable
behavior for estimating intensities from PGA alone, bias correction, and interpolation
(see following sections). Likewise, for smaller-magnitude earthquakes, spectral values
can be noisy, so operators often omit the generation spectral maps below a lower
magnitude threshold (about M4); this can be done with simple command-line options.</p>
<p>For all maps and products, the motions depicted are peak values as observed; that is, the
maximum value observed on the two horizontal components of motion.  Many engineers
are accustomed to analyses employing the geometric mean of the horizontal peak-ground
motions, but that parameter is not computed by ShakeMap. More description and justification
for this strategy is given in the section <a class="reference internal" href="tg_choice_of_parameters.html#peak-values-vs-mean"><span>Use of Peak Values Rather than Mean</span></a>. It should be noted,
however, that conversions from peak to geometric mean [or orientation-independent
parameterizations (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#boore2010"><span>Boore, 2010</span></a>)] are available
(e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#beyer2006"><span>Beyer and Bommer, 2006</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="macroseismic-intensity">
<h2>2.3.3. Macroseismic Intensity<a class="headerlink" href="#macroseismic-intensity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ShakeMap also (optionally) accepts input data in the form of observed macroseismic
intensity (MMI, MCS, etc.). As with peak ground motion parameters from seismic
stations, ShakeMap expects specific file formats (XML) and site metadata for
macroseismic data (see the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span>Software Guide</span></a>).</p>
<p>Intensity data can fill important gaps where ground-motion recordings are not available,
and often provide the only control in sparsely instrumented areas. This is particularly true
for historic earthquakes, for which macroseismic data provide important constraints on
shaking intensities. As later discussed, the ShakeMap Atlas (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2008"><span>Allen et al., 2008</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2009a"><span>2009a</span></a>;
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#garcia2012a"><span>Garcia et al., 2012a</span></a>) is a collection of important historic earthquake shaking maps which
are now widely used for scientific analyses and for loss model calibration (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald2008"><span>Wald et
al., 2008</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#jaiswal2010"><span>Jaiswal and Wald, 2010</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#pomonis2011"><span>Pomonis and So, 2011)</span></a>.</p>
<p>The most common source for immediate post-earthquake intensity data is the USGS&#8217;s
“Did You Feel It?” (DYFI) system (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald2011c"><span>Wald et al., 2011</span></a>), though similar systems are
available in several countries. However, traditionally assigned intensities may be used as
well. DYFI data can be programmatically retrieved from the USGS&#8217;s database and
formatted for ShakeMap input using the ShakeMap program <em>getdyfi</em>, making it
especially easy to incorporate into the ShakeMap data input stream.</p>
<p>Macroseismic intensity data can also be an important constraint on peak ground motions,
since ground motion amplitudes can be derived from intensity through the use of a suitable Ground-Motion/Intensity
Conversion Equation (GMICE). Because a GMICE represents a statistical (probabilistic)
relationship, the conversion to and from intensity has a higher uncertainty than direct
ground-motion observation. ShakeMap accounts for this higher uncertainty by down-
weighting converted observations in the interpolation process, as discussed in the
<a class="reference internal" href="tg_processing.html#sec-interpolation"><span>Interpolation</span></a> section.</p>
<p>A variety of GMICEs are available with the ShakeMap software distribution, both for
MMI&#8212;based on <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald1999b"><span>Wald, et al. (1999b)</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2012"><span>Worden, et al. (2012)</span></a>,
and <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#atkinson2007"><span>Atkinson and Kaka (2007)</span></a>, among others&#8212;and for MCS&#8212;based on <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#faenza2010"><span>Faenza and Michilini (2010)</span></a>. Operators are
encouraged to explore the need to develop their own relationships based on data covering
their own operational area as GMICEs have been shown to have regional dependencies
(e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#caprio2015"><span>Caprio et al., 2015</span></a>). A complete list of GMICEs currently employed by ShakeMap is
provided in the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#sm35-software-guide"><span>Software Guide</span></a>.</p>
<p>We have implemented a convention for maps and regression plots that seismic stations
are represented with triangles and macroseismic data are depicted with circles (see <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-1">Figure  1</a>, for example). This convention is forward-looking: not all seismic networks were
currently following this convention at the time of this writing.</p>
